This project based on IMDB movies. 
there are many data available on the IMDB movies. but here I worked on tableau tool and make some questions from the available dataset. 
this project is just simple undersatanding of how we can work with "EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS" along with tableu tool.
and from the EDA we can solve our different quesrtion in the tool.

*In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.

* when at the first stage if we looked into the dataset we should have many questions and at the last what result we want to pget is our main aim. 
* so EDA will help to solve our major questions and from there we can find related answers. 

* I prepared some questions from this dataset which basically based on the correlations, revenue and various genres. 
* I prepared all questions first and after that worked on the Tableau to get the proper solution according my EDA.
* I also explained my all theory step by step along with pictures which I uploded in this repository. 
*In this project document is important part for the better undersatnding of the project. 

* EDA:-
* 1. 1.	Is there any relationship between movie budget and revenue?
* 2.	What are the duration outliers in various genres of movies?
* 3.	How is the distribution of various movie duration?
* 4.	Does having more Facebook likes have an impact on revenue?
* 5.	Is there any relationship between various Facebook likes and IMDB voting?
* 6.	Correlation matrix between various numerical data points
* 7.	Is the genre budget changing as time is changing?
* 8.	What is the distribution of IMDB ratings among various genres?
* 9.	What is the most revenue-fetching category for a movie?
